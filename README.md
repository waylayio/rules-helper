# Waylay Task SDK

## intro

This library will allow the user to create waylay tasks in an easier way.

There's two ways to use this library:

* with a config and the so called subflows
* with a chain style builder which requires no config

More on the specific ways below.

This is **not** a UI library.

## Installation

```cli
npm install @waylay/rules-helper
```
